# Hello World
<br>
Welcome to my site. I'm Andy Tran. I'm a product manager in tech, currently living in Seattle. I created this site to write about and showcase my professional and personal projects. Professionally, I love collaborating with engineering and design teams to create products that leverage data and automation to solve customer and business problems.

# About my career
I started my career in New York City as a research associate for a nonprofit focused on low performing schools in NYC, Newark, NJ, and Washington DC. There I analyzed data and created reports to assess the nonprofit's effectiveness. I transitioned to big tech starting with an operational role in digital advertising. I created internal tools to automate data analyses and transitioned into a business intelligence role to focus on improving the tools and setup the ETL infrastructure for more sophisticated tools. As my scope grew, I transitioned into product management to lead larger efforts across engineering, design, marketing, and beyond to launch impactful products and features.
